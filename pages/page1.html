    <h1>“I wonder what Piglet is doing," thought Pooh.
    "I wish I were there to be doing it, too.”</h1>
    <p>
        “Ditch your day of do nothing, Christopher Robin” declared Owl from overhead. “We are having a party!” <br />
        Animals gathered round the table of tea and juice. They fitted themselves with hats made specially by Roo. “Cake, cakes, and cakes” mumbled Rabbit, setting trays of all manner of vegetable cake about. “And oh!” He said, darting away and back with Kanga’s honey cakes for Pooh, Roo, Christopher Robin, and you. Tigger, all abounce and aboing, apologizes for knocking your tea to the ground. <br />
        “I think we’ve forgotten someone, Pooh,” Eeyore’s voice emerged from under the table. “Ah emnfcp!” said Pooh, mouth full of several cakes. <br />
        “What a mystery, and more mysterious still. I can’t remember what we are celebrating! Would you help me puzzle this out, Aoife?” Inquired Owl. <br />
