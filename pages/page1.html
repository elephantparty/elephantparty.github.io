“Ditch your day of do nothing, Christopher Robin” d<b>e<b>clared owl from overhead. “We are having a party!” <br />

Animals gathered round the table of tea and <b>j<b>uice. They fitted themselves with hats made specially by Roo. “Cake<b>s<b>, cakes, and cakes” mumbled rabbit setting trays of all manner of veggetable cake about. “And oh!” He said darting away and back with Kanga’s honey cakes for Pooh, Roo, Christofer Robin, and you. Tigger, all abounce and aboing, apologi<b>z<b>es for knocking your tea to the ground. <br />

“What a mystery, and more mysterious still. I can’t remember what we are <b>c<b>elebrating! Would you help me puzzle this out, Aoife?” In<b>q<b>uired Owl. <br />
