    <h1>“I wonder what Piglet is doing," thought Pooh.
    "I wish I were there to be doing it, too.”</h1>
    <p>
        “Ditch your day of do nothing, Christopher Robin” declared Owl from overh<b>e</b>ad. “We are having a party!” <br />
        Animals gathered round the table of tea and <b>j</b>uice. They fit<b>t</b>ed themselves with hats made specially by Roo. “Cake, cakes, and cakes” mumbled Rabbit, setting trays of all manner of vegetable cake about. “And oh!” He said, darting away and back with Kanga’s honey cakes for Pooh, Roo, Christopher Robin, and you. Tigger, all abounce and aboing, apologi<b>z</b>es for knocking your tea to the ground. <br />
        “I think we’ve forgotten <b>s</b>omeone, Pooh,” Eeyore’s voice emerged from under the table. “Ah emnfcp!” said Pooh, mouth full of several cakes. <br />
        “What a mystery, and more <b>m</b>ysterious still. I can’t remember what we are <b>c</b>elebrating! Would you help me puzzle this out, Aoife?” In<b>q</b>uired Owl. <br />

    You did it! I knew you could (: I love you so much and Happy Valentines Day!! <br />
    I love growing with you and knowing more about you than anyone else! (and maybe even yourself *in the least creepy way possible*) <br />
    It's amusing to recall some of my initial attempts to impress you. I thought that those antique law texts I got you for your birthday 
    would demonstrate some sort of enlightened tastefulness on my part. You've taught me that the most appreciated gift, at least to you, 
    is an investment of time. I love your endless thoughtfullness for others, and your kindness towards all the little creatures and things.
    You are a gifted, animated storyteller and my best friend. OH! And you're so beautiful, so pretty. You are so smart, so funny. I love to laugh, 
    and I laugh a lot, but I laugh with you more than any other time. I'm so excited for your visit. Treats galore! Beautiful architecture! 
    Yummy food! Cool art! Maybe a museum! Cozy snuggles! Tight train cars! Holding warm hands! Sights from the Sound of Music? I'm so proud 
    of you for managing a tricky semester after a big shift from Portland to Philly. I'm excited to hear about all that you accomplish. 
    I love you forever and always, lovebug.
