    <h1>Fastitocalon</h1>
      <p>Hear my story.</p>

  <p><em>
    Algae broiled in the low sun and heat waves shimmered in the grey pond. Soaring through the spring dusk and past the scummy bank, I see
    a turtle spread out on a sizeable protruding rock. Her beak is fixed in a satisfied grin as she bakes in her shell. The pleasant
    scene causes me to switch hosts, falling into a water hyacinth. Another turtle surfaces. He clambers up the rock and his eyes bulge
    as he appears to hold back a cough. Miraculously, the new arrival begins to hum! He rocks back and forth on his legs, awaking the
    original occupant who peers at him with a single eye. A muted crack echoes across the water, and then another as his shell splits
    and splits again. Toes stretch, arms distend, and tiny eyes inflate and shake with horror. When the process is done, a man,
    completely hairless and nude, is sprawled, butt-up, across the rock. The fingers of his right hand stir the algae ponderously.
    Breaking from his trance, he addresses the lady turtle, “Long time no see, Arlet.” The little turtle, apparently called Arlet,
    ambles over to the naked guy, and appears to consider for a moment before extending her neck and biting him on the chin.
    “ACK!” he exclaims, retreating to the edge of the rock and gathering the four pieces of shell he'd left behind. Arlet continues
    her advance on the guy as he presses the pieces of shell along the cracked edges, and flattens the whole thing as if made of putty.
    The pieces fuse and he hurriedly places his work atop his shiny head. Arlet stops as he rounds the edges of the shell to observe
    the contour of his cranium. The two creatures gurgle at each other.

    Lucky for you, dear reader, I inferred a great deal of their conversation from the body-language. Something about a ritual, or
    was it a seance? What's the difference, actually? Anyhow, they were big readers. The Brothers Karamazov—or actually no, not quite…
    And Arlet was incredibly grouchy. I can't remember the password. I need a little help jogging my memory as I'm right at the door!
